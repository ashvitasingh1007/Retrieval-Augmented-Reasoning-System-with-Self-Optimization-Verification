# Retrieval-Augmented-Reasoning-System-with-Self-Optimization-Verification
Built a retrieval-augmented reasoning system integrating semantic search (FAISS), chunked document retrieval, and LLM-based generation. Added verification and hybrid evaluation using embeddings and LLM judgment to reduce hallucinations and improve answer grounding, with a Streamlit demo for interaction.
🔍 Peebite: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning System
Self-Optimizing, Verifiable, and Transparent AI Pipeline

🧠 A research-oriented AI system that doesn’t just generate answers—it retrieves evidence, verifies outputs, and evaluates confidence, mimicking a real researcher’s workflow.

🚀 Overview

Most AI systems produce answers in a single pass—often unverified and unreliable.

Peebite introduces a multi-stage reasoning pipeline that ensures:

📚 Evidence-backed responses
🔍 Verification against retrieved knowledge
📊 Confidence scoring and evaluation
🔁 Structured reasoning instead of guesswork
🧩 System Architecture
User Query

🔎 Retriever (Dense Retrieval)
   ↓
🧠 Generator (LLM Reasoning)
   ↓
🔍 Verifier (Evidence Alignment)
   ↓
📊 Evaluator (Confidence Scoring)

📢 Final Answer + Verification + Score
⚙️ Core Components
🔎 Retriever
Uses embedding-based search (FAISS / semantic retrieval)
Fetches relevant documents to ground responses
🧠 Generator
Produces structured answers using retrieved context
Encourages reasoning instead of surface-level generation
🔍 Verifier
Cross-checks generated answers with retrieved evidence
Identifies unsupported or weak claims
📊 Evaluator
Assigns confidence score based on:
Semantic similarity
Evidence support
Completeness
🧪 Research-Oriented Features
🔄 Retrieval + reasoning integration
🧠 Evidence-based generation
⚠️ Hallucination mitigation via verification
📈 Quantifiable reliability (confidence score)
🧩 Modular pipeline for experimentation
🎯 Example Capabilities

✔ Answering complex queries with context grounding
✔ Detecting weak or unsupported claims
✔ Providing reliability scores
✔ Exposing retrieved context for transparency

📚 FAISS / Vector Search
🔍 Sentence Transformers

🧠 Why This Project Matters

Most RAG systems focus only on retrieval + generation.

Peebite goes further:

✔ Adds verification layer → reduces hallucination
✔ Adds evaluation layer → measures reliability
✔ Enables transparent reasoning pipeline

👉 This reflects a research mindset, not just application building.

🔮 Future Improvements
🔀 Hybrid retrieval (dense + keyword)
📊 Advanced evaluation metrics
🧠 Multi-step reasoning chains
🔗 Multi-document synthesis
